    "##  Yearly Average Citizen Intensity Consumption calculation per country.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step to estimate european citizens consumption footprint by country using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) it is necessary to calculate the consumption intensity of the representative products considered (in general those bearing most of the env. impacts) groupped into Baskets of Products (BoP). The present script contains the functions dedicated to the extraction and harmonization of the data on the Mobility BoP products and the calculation of the corresponding consumption intensities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three data sources used in this case are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [EC Mobility and Transport Statistical Pocketbook](https://ec.europa.eu/transport/facts-fundings/statistics/pocketbook-2019_en)(PB).\n",
    "- [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat)(ESTAT).\n",
    "- [Consumer Footprint. Basket of Products indicator on mobility](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/consumer-footprint-basket-products-indicator-mobility) report(Rep.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific categories, datasets and tables from each of the sources used here can be found in the [ds_transport](#ds_transport) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the Mobility BoP representative products, what follows is a summary of all the representative products considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Road transport**:\n",
    "  - *Passenger cars*: 16 types classified according to their fuel type, capacity and year of production.\n",
    "  - *Two wheels*: 3 types classified according to their capacity and year of production.\n",
    "  - *Buses*: 3 types lassified according to their weight and year of production.\n",
    "- **Rail transport**: Either diesel or electric.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Air transport**: intra-EU, extra-EU and international flights.\n",
    " \n",
    "For each of the main transport groups the following data will be retrieved:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Passenger cars*: million passenger km (PB), type of fuel, engine displacement and technology coefficients (ESTAT) and occupancy factors (Rep.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Two wheels*: number of vehicles (ESTAT), number of vehicles (ESTAT), contribution to passenger km and occupancy factor (Rep.). Besides, the number of vehicles per category will be calculated out of the number of vehicles figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Buses*: number of vehicles (ESTAT), number of vehicles (ESTAT) and occupancy factors (Rep.). Besides, the number of vehicles per category will be calculated out of the number of vehicles figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rail transport**: Millions of trains km (ESTAT), million passenger km (PB) and occupancy factors (Rep.). Besides the share of trains by category is calculated out of the millions of trains km figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Air transport**: Number of passengers (PB) and km per flight (Rep.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases the data retrieved from the original sources is already ready to be used, however in other cases it will have to undergo some modifications before it can be used. A third case would be those additional figures which are calculated out of the originally retrieved data, which are the following for the different transport groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Two wheels*: the number of vehicles per category will be calculated out of the number of vehicles figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Buses*: the number of vehicles per category will be calculated out of the number of vehicles figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rail transport**: the share of trains by category is calculated out of the millions of trains km figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions in this script will fill out the spaces of a previously created frame table containing only the information about the different transport groups and subgroups names with the retrieved, modified and calcuated figures under the corresponding column. In that table the names of the columns are short forms of the original name (e.g. *tech_coeff* for technology coefficients) and its correspondance with the actual figure name can be found wihtin the [ds_transport](#ds_transport) function.\n"

    "In addition to Python 3.3 built-in packages and some other specific packages, such as the [*eurostat*](https://pypi.org/project/eurostat/) package, two previously developed scripts, *data_inputs* and *predownload* will have to be loaded too. In order to simplify the loading it is recommended to copy both of the into the current working dictionary, i.e. where the present script is located. Finally, within that same directory, a *input* folder has to be created and the pocketbook (e.g. *pb2019-section23.xls*) as well as the previously mentioned frame table (*mob_frame.xlsx*) copied inside it."
